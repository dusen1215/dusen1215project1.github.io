            <p style="font-family:courier;">After finishing the New York City College of Technology, I now possess the skills and unique assets to find what is unique in you.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started college on an arts, full-ride scholarship for two years right after high school. I then attended a university in Kansas and moved to New York to attend the New York Film Academy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Once my program completed, I wrote for the Broadway Comedy Club and acted in commercials, plays, television shows, etc. I even edited projects and constructed my own reel.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have the creative input to proceed with any vision you desire, or I will help you find that vision. </p></div>
